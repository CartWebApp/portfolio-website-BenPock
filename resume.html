            <p>Throughout my time in Highschool I have obtained a plethora of skills. The most useful of these skills I
                obtained at The Center for Advanced Research and Technology (Cart).The skills I learned there helped me
                push
                forward with my work. One of the best skills I learned there was to self teach, Cart is a college level
                course you can take in Highschool and because of its college nature it took a more hands off approach to
                my
                learning which helped me develop the ability to teach myself anything I might not know.</p>

                am
                currently learning Javascript.Cart has given me the ability to create these websites and start building
                up

            <p>I consider myself a hardworker and someone who will always complete a task when need be.I work well under
                pressure and am able to work for most hours of the day if needed.I am a quick learner so even if i've
                been
                given a task where i don't know how to complete it i will figure it out in the end.I an not afraid to
                ask
                questions to make sure the website i'm making is to your exact standards.</p>
