        <p class="firstdivinetext">This is the first project I made with mostly javascript with the code being over 1300
            lines.We were tasked with making an adventure story with 3 or more starts and 3 or more endings in the end
            me and my teammate ended up making 3 starts and 15 endings.We did this by making a dialogue script and a
            button that would advance that dialogue.This script is the main part of our game without there would be no
            game whatsoever</p>

        <p class="seconddivinetext">These are examples of our game we have the person talking in the image on the left
            and the scene on the big image in the middle.
            Another main part of our code was the path selector show above
            there are three different options and each one will lead you down to a different ending and change how the
            story plays out</p>
